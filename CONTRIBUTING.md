# Contributing to the Ba$hIt CLI Texting App

Thanks for contributing to the Ba$hIt project! This is a new project, so any contributions are greatly welcome.

## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution

If you notice a problem with the code or functionality that you believe needs improvement
but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue
containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of
the content and/or screenshots if applicable. Curriculum owners regularly review
issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go
ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

* Fork this curriculum repository
* Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
* Open a Pull Request against this repo

A developer will review your change and approve or comment on it in due
course.

# Why Contribute?

This app has the potential to serve as a great simple but useful tool. As of now, 
there isn't the server side implementation, and so this project would greatly be helped by those contributors. Also, there may be bugs that contributors can help fix, as the time to develop this app was relatively expidited!
